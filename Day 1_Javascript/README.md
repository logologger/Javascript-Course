    Divide every thing between pages js in js file and css in css file


    	Before Shuffle one ..Need to tell him the concept of function in Javascript..

    	How are functions taken in Javascript 

    	while loop will be taken here only in the shuffle only 

    	if will be taken here only

    	switch needs to be taken along with it ------>  Can be taken up with a Calculator Example

    	IIFE -- will be taken up later


		The idea here is to shuffle the array from index 0 to 4 ..

		Generate a random index 
		Shuffle the element at that index with top Element
		top-- 
		Keep on repeating it until top becomes 0 

		Although it does not completely shuffle the array but gives enough amount of randomness to the output array


		If there is any error in any line in Javascript then Entire Execution stops there in the array

		Use the interval function to execute this Color Rainbow from time to time

		Difference between Timeout and Interval


		Dealing with the form Elements in the array

		Need to taken up constructor , Classes and inheritance

		Design a  Calculator in JS

		MouseHover Property ----onmousemove , mouseenter ,onmouseover

		document.write

		try and catch in Javascript

		Browser Object --window,location,screen,history	navigator

		HTML5 Video and Audio

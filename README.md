<h3>This course will be a backbone for the JAVASCRIPT Course</h3>

<b>Day 1:</b> It will be focused on  What HTML,CSS and Javascript is and their scope in future


<b>Day 2:</b> We will go with a code level implementation of Javascript ...Event(User Action) and how we can change the HTML and CSS . We need to discuss what is DOM tree and how the HTML,CSS and JS are rendered on the screen using it.

<b>Day 3:</b> It will be covering the implementation of Simple Project Design which will be a color changer based on the user action and how we can implement it . How we can automate this color changing using setInterval and use of setTimeout.We will cover array concept in Javascript here

<b>Day 4 </b>: Design simple application that tells whether user is online or offline and based  that change the color of the button or div layout.Dealing with Custom Events in Javascript like MouseHover , Click , DoubleClick and other one.We can strict comparision in javascript.Difference between null and undefined

<b>Day 5 </b>:We will continue with how Javascipt Propogates the event in the DOM tree. This day will be focused on function , while loop in javascript ...We will be designing a random color changer.

<b>Day 6 </b>: This day we will cover for and do while loop with a simple application (Design awaited). We will cover how we can design a simple calculator using javascript.

<b>Dat 7 </b>: This day we will cover the entire functionality of javascript calculator and how to use switch case in acheiving this.

<b>Day 8 : </b> This day we will cover how we can handle exceptions in Javascript and how the normal flow in javascript happens.How we can debug in chrome console and debugging in javascript happens.

<b> Day 9:</b> This day we will design a simple form (Add User Registration or Music or Another Stuff). and how to deal with validations in Javascript and Using Regex pattern in Javascript

<b>Day 10: </b> This day we will deal with the Object creation in Javascript and JSON Objects in Javascript. Fetching values in JSON Object . Uses of them for data transfer .How it is used in MongoDB  for data storing.Form JSON Object Dynamically.

<b>Day 11:</b> We have covered nearly all the basic Concepts of JS.Here we can cover all the javascript API that are provided by the browser like Date API, Location fetching API, navigator API, history API and may be Live Video API and Audio(Mircophone API).

<b>Day 12:</b> Till now we have covered maximum of the concepts of the javasript.Now we will be dealing with IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function in javascript), Global Variables in Javascript and javascript handles them .. Scope of Variables in Javascript., We will be dealing with closure in Javascript.

<b>Day 13</b>: Here we will be continuing Closure and seeking one use case in Javascript Application.After this we will be dealing with prototypes in Javascript. How Prototpical Inheritance is done in Javascript and how we can use it in our application .. Mostly We will see how our application uses it.

<b>Day 14</b> Today we will be dealing with Functional Programming in Javascript and how javascript is better in functional programming rather then object Oriented Programming . We will deal with High-Order functions in Javascript. Map in Javascript . Reduce in Javascript.

<b>Day 15 </b>: Today we will continue the functional programming and deal with Currying in javascript .. Recursion in Javascript. Promises in JS , Functors ... MONAD.  , Stream 

<b>Day 16 </b> : We will continue the above concepts with some practical examples , and then we will give some design pattern of how large application are built using functional programming 

<b> Day 17 </b>: We will deal with Object Oriented way of Javascript .. Use of new keyword . Creating Construtors and Class in Javascript.Creating Objects in Javascript. Some Features coming in ES6 for the Object Oriented Programming in Javascript. We will discuss how javascript is shifting towards OOPs from Functional way.We will discuss use of bind and this in Javascript.

<b> Day 18:</b> We will discuss use of Prototypes in Javascript. Object creating using Prototypes. Use of __proto__ and Protoypes in Javascipt .. by showing it in console. how Different frameworks are built using this concept.

<b> Day 19:</b> We will continue the above disussion with some cool project examples and implementation.After this we will discuss some ES6 features like let, const keyword. Arrows functions in JS . Generators in JS .Destructuring in JS.

<b>Day 20:</b> This day we wil focus on Asynchronous Programming in JS.What are callbacks and callback hell. Use of Promises for callback rescue. then Using Generators for dealing with it, async and await in JS.

<b>Day 21:</b> Today We will be some left-overs in Javascipt like Apply ,call and bind..Variable Scoping and hoisting . Then We will see Design Patterns Followed in Javascript mostly from reference from airbnb , google . Then We will see how we can detect performance , Timelines , Debugging and Other tools in Chrome Debugger.We will be dealing with AJAX call in Javascript. 

<b> Day 22:</b> This day we will continue the above Concepts and Discuss the various frameworks like ReactJS, Angular2 , Backbone JS ,KnockoutJS etc that are driving the JS world.We will see how JQuery library helps in reducing the lines of code in JS and how it is much helpful. We will give a brief overview of NodeJS (Server Side Programming in JS)
